    "\n",
    "Now you have learnt how to make $N$-body simulations, we can start to find DM halos from the particles. And the most commonly used method for this is called the friends-of-friends (fof) algorithm. The idea is quite simple: if a DM particle $A$ is close enough to any other particles belong to a DM halo $B$, then particle $A$ belongs to halo $B$. You can read more about the friends of friends algorithm at e.g. here: https://swift.dur.ac.uk/docs/FriendsOfFriends/algorithm_description.html\n",

    "* Plot particles that are in haloes\n",
    "* Plot a halo mass function\n",
