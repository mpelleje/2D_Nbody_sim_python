    "### Introduction\n",
    "Now you have learned the concept of **Zel'dovich approximation**, which is stating that the displacement field $\\Psi(\\bold{q})$ at linear order at **any redshifts** can be approximated once you know the initial potential field. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking, that sounds too good to be true. The motion of particles should be determined by the distribution of matter and the velocity of particles at that instant. And both the matter distribution and the velocity are ever changing so you need to carry out the simulation step by step. How is it possible to know the displacement of particles from $z=99$ to $z=0$ **in one step** only given the matter distribution at $z=99$? Good spirit! As a researcher, you need to be sceptical. But in this notebook, you will find it out yourself that sometimes nature can be as magical as the Zel'dovich approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "We will work with a code, `sheet_unfolding`, for 2d simulations as this can help you to master the key concepts for running simulations and greatly reduce the computation time. The code is only well implemented for EdS universe, so we will keep $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=1,\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "* Get the initial condition\n",
    "* Get the matter distribution at given redshifts using the Zel'dovich approximation\n",
    "* Run a real simulation with the same initial condition, compare the results with those from Zel'dovich approximation"

Although you can also see that the on small scale, the Zel'dovich approximation seems giving a thicker filament structure than the 'real' simulation. Why is that? Also, there seems to be something weird in both the Zel'dovich approximation and the 'real' simulation: in the Zel'dovich approximation it has this grid like points and in the real simulation the points seems forming a line in the void region. What is causing this?"
