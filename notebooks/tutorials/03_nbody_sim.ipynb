    "### Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to learn how to run a cosmological N-body simulation. If you take a moment to think about it, the idea is quite straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the initial conditions $[\\vec{x_i},\\vec{v_i},m_i]$ for each particle.\n",
    "2. Compute the gravitational force acting on each particle.\n",
    "3. Choose an appropriate time step and update $[\\vec{x_i},\\vec{v_i}]$ for each particle using the equations of motion.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired epoch is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the lectures, youâ€™ve learned that there are several methods for calculating gravitational forces, such as tree codes and particle-mesh methods. In the previous notebook, you mastered how to compute the force field by obtaining the potential in Fourier space using mesh cells. So in this notebook, we will adopt the particle-mesh method for force calculation."

    "## CIC for Density Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we skipped the density estimation step by using the linear density field, which is a built-in function in `sim.ic.IC2DCosmo()`. In the first notebook, we actually calculated the density by simply counting the number of particles in each cell. This method is known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) or nearest grid point (NGP) method for density estimation. It is simple, fast, and has been widely used in research.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, PIC can produce discontinuities between adjacent cells. Also, in simulations, we often have a single DM particle with mass $\\gtrsim 10^6\\,M_{\\odot}$, so modeling all the mass as being concentrated at a single point is not ideal for estimating the overdensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection, we will explore the Clouds-in-Cells (CIC) method for density estimation and compare it with PIC. The idea is, assume the mass is distributed in a square (for 2d) of the same size as the grid, and the mass can be attributed to at most 4 cells depending on how much the square overlap with the cells. In this way we can avoid the discontinuity and the point-mass problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Make a plot comparing the CIC overdensities with a normal histogram for a Zel'dovich approximation at $a=0.05$ and $a=0.5$."

What we need to know is the accelaration at the particle positions rather than the cell center positions. Should two particles in the same grid cell have the same acceleration when one is at the very left of the cell while the other is at the very right? The answer is no, you should do a linear interpolation of the acceleration field to get the acceleration at arbituary positions. You can simply use `sim.sim.linear_interp2d()` for this.
